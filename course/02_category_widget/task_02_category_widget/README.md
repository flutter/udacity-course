# task_02_category_widget

Create your own custom widget

Given an icon, name, and color, create a Category  widget that uses these input parameters.
Specs:
 - Widget height: 100.0
 - Icon size: 60.0
 - Icon-with-colored-background width: 70.0
 - Text size: 24.0
 - The InkWell will not show any animation if the onTap function is null. Just make it print something, i.e.:
     onTap: () {
       print('I was tapped!');
     },


You should end up with something like this:
